### [Repairing A and B State behavior on ROG Ally](https://github.com/bactaholic/chimeraos-ROG-Ally-tricks/blob/main/repairing-b-state-behavior.md)
When installing ChimeraOS on ROG Allys there are 3 possible states of operation. In state A the QAM/Steam buttons do not function except for on the first boot, any sleep/wake cycles break it. State B is indicated by a "light switch" type behavior, where every sleep/wake cycle toggles the buttons. Then there is state C where all buttons function all the time. This guide provides a workaround for A and B state ROG Allys to force C state behavior, though, with some quirks.

### [Installing Custom 6.5.0 Kernel by @NeroReflex](https://github.com/bactaholic/chimeraos-ROG-Ally-tricks/blob/main/installing_custom_6.5.0_kernel.md)
ChimeraOS, at the time of writing this, installs with an older kernel, this 6.5.0 is compiled specifically for the ROG Ally and brings noticable performance improvements.
